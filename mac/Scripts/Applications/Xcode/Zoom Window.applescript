(* Zoom Window

Zoom the current Xcode window to a comfortable width and the full screen
height. Use a different width for editor windows and project windows.

In my multi-monitor setup, the screens are always horizontally adjacent,
the main display is on the largest screen, and Xcode is always on the main
display, and all of my monitors are 16x10. That's why I can figure out the
screen size programmatically.

See [1] for a discussion of problems with getting the screen dimensions in
a multi-monitor setup.
