	See http://www.entropy.ch/software/applescript/ for the latest
	version of this script.
	
	
	History:
	
	30-OCT-2001: Version 1.0, adapted from one of the example toolbar scripts
	30-OCT-2001: Now handles embedded single quote characters in file names
	30-OCT-2001: Now handles folders on volumes other than the startup volume
	30-OCT-2001: Now handles click on icon in top-level (machine) window
	31-OCT-2001: Now displays a nicer terminal window title, courtesy of Alain Content
	11-NOV-2001: Now folders within application packages (.app directories) and has a new icon
	12-NOV-2001: New properties to set terminal columns and rows as the Terminal does not use default settings
	14-NOV-2001: Major change, now handles 8-bit characters in all shells, and quotes and spaces in tcsh
	18-NOV-2001: Version 1.1: Rewrite, now uses a temporary file  ~/.OpenTerminalHere to communicate
	             the directory name between AppleScript and the shell because this is much more reliable for 8-bit characters
	16-JAN-2006: Version 2.0: Rewrite, now uses "quoted form of" and "POSIX Path". This gets rid of
	             Perl and temp files, but it no longer handles files instead of folders.
	24-JAN-2007: Version 2.1: Integrated enhancements by Stephan Hradek, can again handle dropped files.
	06-AUG-2008: Version 2.2: Added terminal control sequence to clear the visible cd command.
    26-OCT-2008: Version 2.3: Incorporated changes from Florian ?, handling case where Terminal was not already running
